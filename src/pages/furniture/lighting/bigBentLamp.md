An iteration on a previous design, this is scaled up floor lamp variation of my [bent lamp](/furniture/lighting/bentLamp.html).

The construction was essentially the same as the previous post. The biggest difference being that I used a proper shade I purchased from Ikea. I will probably redo the shade at some point, but for now the pink orb works well enough.
