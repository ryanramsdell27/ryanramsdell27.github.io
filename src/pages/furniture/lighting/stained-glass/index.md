I was a bit ambitious on this project, turns out stained-glass is incredibly hard to do. In my naivety I thought it would be as simple as "cut the shapes and piece them together". Cutting accurately: hard. Soldering cleanly: harder. Soldering in 3D: impossibly difficult. But I finished it (or close enough at any rate). 

This lamp was greatly inspired by the work of [Shawn Michael Lucas](http://www.shawnmlucas.com).
