Just a quick update on the status of my [big bent lamp](/furniture/lighting/bigBentLamp.html).

I wasn't a big fan of the pink shade so I swapped it out for a pleated paper shade.

The weight of the shade ended up being too much for kerf bend at the base to handle, and the lamp ended up snapping when a slight breeze from the patio door caused the shade to swing.

The original freestanding lamp was not salvageable (glue did not work). Instead, I opted to lop off the original base and mount the remainder to the wall.
