![Chandelier](1.jpeg)

Originally this fixture was made to provide better lighting in the bathroom of my old place. It now serves as the chandelier over my kitchen table.

![Raw materials](making_1.jpeg)
The construction is pretty simple. It is made from sections of aluminum flashing that have been spray-painted and then fastened together with some machine screws to form circles. The screws work as hooks to hold each section of the shade with twine that is threaded through a board on top

The board has a holes for the twine to pass through as well as a larger one for a pendant light. The twine is tied around the cord of the pendant fixture to hold the shades level at and at the appropriate heights.
