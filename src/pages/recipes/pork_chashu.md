This is a very forgiving recipe, make alterations as you see necessary. Perfect sliced up in ramen.

# Ingredients
- Pork belly
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup sake
- 2 cups Water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 spring onion or 2-3 green onions
- 3-4 cloves of garlic

# Instructions
1. Roll and tie the pork belly (for larger portions) or cut into 1 inch wide strips
1. Sear the pork belly on medium-high heat until golden and crisp on all sides
1. Add everything to a pot, adjust soy sauce, sake, and water as necessary to submerge most/all the pork belly
1. Cook at a simmer for 2-3 hours
1. Allow to cool, transfer to container with liquid and store in fridge for 24 hours before serving

# Alterations
- If I don't have sake on hand I just use whatever white cooking wine I have on hand
- Sometimes I will replace some of the soy sauce with dark soy sauce or Knorr liquid seasoning
