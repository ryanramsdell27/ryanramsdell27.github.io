<p>I picked up this chair for $16 from a local vintage store. It was in pretty rough shape but had great bones to work with.</p>

The existing upholstery was not salvageable. So many holes and it seemed like something may have gotten into the foam of the seat pad at some point. So I stripped the fabric and foam and was able to re-cover the shaped mdf with new foam and fabric. Shaping the foam was quite the experience, I made a special tool from a jam lid I punched some holes in with a nail. The resulting tool let me pass over the foam and shave off parts in order to get it to the shape I wanted. The shavings were impossible to clean and stuck to everything &hellip; do not do this indoors.</p>

<p>Refinishing the shell was pretty straightforward. All I did was sand it down a bit then spray paint with white.</p>

<p>The base paint was peeling and generally in bad shape. I used citri-strip to remove it. After several application I was able to git it down to bare metal. I decided I liked the chrome look and kept it as it was.</p>
